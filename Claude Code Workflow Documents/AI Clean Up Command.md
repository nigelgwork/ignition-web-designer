Please perform a quick cleanup and refactoring pass:

1. **Directory Check**: Review the current directory structure. Remove any temporary files, outdated versions, or test files we no longer need.

2. **Code Consolidation**: Identify any duplicated code across files and refactor into shared utilities/modules where appropriate.

3. **File Organization**: Ensure files are in logical directories (e.g., /src, /tests, /utils, /docs) rather than scattered in the root.

4. **Code Quality**: Quick refactor of any verbose or repetitive code sections to be more concise and maintainable.

5. **Documentation**: Update or create a brief README.md with the current project structure and status.

6. **Image Removal**: Remove any unecessary image files that might have been used for context in previous discussions

7. **Context Summary**: Provide a 2-3 sentence summary of what we've accomplished and what remains.

Keep all essential functionality intact, but optimize for clarity and minimal file count.
